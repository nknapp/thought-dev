This project is a development-mode for the {{npm 'thought'}} project. It shows you, which
partials are currently in use and allows you to override partials and store them in the appropriate
locations.

**Use at your own risk. This package is highly experimental. It works for me, kind of, but there
are no tests at all. And sometimes, the server just breaks down. The code is not clean and everything
is somehow work in progress. I'm publishing it anyhow.**
