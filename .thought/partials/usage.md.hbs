## Usage

Go the the project folder and run 

```bash
thought-dev
```

Then open a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or whatever
port is displayed in the console.

You will see a list of files in your project, probably including a [README.md](http://localhost:3000/README.md).

The README.md file is generated by {{npm 'thought'}} from Handlebars templates and a list of partials.
You will see the partials on the left and the contents of the README.md on the right.

* Hover over the README and the areas generated by a partial will be highlighted. 
* Click on the README (even on a link) and the corresponding partial on the left will be opened. 
* You can click on **Edit** to override a file and open an editor (specified in the EDITOR-environment variable) on the copy.
* You can click on **Revert** to delete the local file, which will revert the contents of the default version from the Thought project.
